# catFacts

A Simple Python App to send people cat facts. 

Utilizses https://catfact.ninja/ API to pull facts then sends via a Twilio Account to your recipient.

Current;y In progress. Send button is fucked up and the I'm Feeling Lucky button doesn't do shit. Check the logs, it says so.

Intent is to fix Send, have the Lucky Button do a popup, and add scheduling/frequency configuration. Will probably
redo the UI at some point with something nicer too but who the fuck knows.


4/24: 
Fixed Send
Added Popup
Added Random frequency triggered by send
